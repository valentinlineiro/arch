# CHANGELOG.md

All notable changes to the ARCH framework are documented here.

Format: `[type] description — [evidence or rationale]`
Types: `Added` `Changed` `Fixed` `Removed` `Migration`

Versioning rules:
- `MAJOR` — breaks existing task format or agent protocols (migration guide required)
- `MINOR` — new agent, new task class, new document (backward compatible)
- `PATCH` — improved instructions, reduced token cost, clarified protocol (transparent)
