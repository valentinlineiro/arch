**ADRs:**
- ADR-002: Context as a budget, not a default _(enforced)_

- ADR-008: Centralize halt conditions in HALT.md _(enforced)_

**Guidelines:**
- testing-a-change.md
- versioning.md

**Failure Patterns:**
- Decision Blindness (High Velocity)*(Sprint 3)*: The agent executes architectural changes (ADR) and detects bugs (TASK-061) that stay in logs or PRs without immediate human visibility. High velocity (35 tasks/48h) makes individual monitoring impossible. **Proposal:** GOVERNANCE.md contract + INBOX.md weekly dashboard + `arch inbox` agent. _(docs/KAIZEN-LOG.md)_
- Invariant Discovery Gap*(2026-05-12)*: The boundary ambiguity between `arch govern` (deterministic enforcement) and THINK (LLM analysis) was not surfaced by any ARCH mechanism. No DriftChecker rule, no structural check, no semantic scan detected it. A human noticed it during a reflection session. The specific risk: `arch govern` triggers THINK via `runConduct()`, creating naming confusion between enforcement and advisory synthesis — with no written invariant to refuse the rationalization "THINK already participates in govern, so it can also…". **Resolution:** Constitutional split written in IDENTITY.md §7. IDEA-architectural-tension-capture proposed as a new artifact class for structural ambiguities that are not yet broken but will be misused. **The deeper pattern:** ARCH models tasks, decisions, and causal edges, but not category errors or ontological drift. Invariants that live only in the author's head do not scale. _(docs/KAIZEN-LOG.md)_

### Context Feedback
- [ ] accurate — files and ADRs were on-target
- [ ] partial — correct direction, missing key files
- [ ] off — wrong files dominated

#### Intent
Implement verifiability-first AC templates per task class in arch task capture: class-specific default AC templates with at least one cmd:/file: predicate, verifiability score displayed at capture time (% ACs with machine-verifiable predicates, warn below threshold), explicit prose: annotation for semantically-required prose ACs. Change what counts as a valid governance object at origin.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All ACs checked by Auditor
- [ ] `arch review` passes
